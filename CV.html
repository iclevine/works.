Project 1: Lasercutting
</div>

<div id = "description">
I started thinking I wanted to make a record shelf with a spectogram (frequency analysis) of a song etched into it <br>
It would be an amalgamation of plywood and acrylic, with the spectrogram laser engraved into the acrylic part. <br>
<br>
Spectrogram: <br>

I first tested this by cutting and engraving a few parts at the laser cutter and more than liking the parts themselves, I noticed a cool effect on the edges. <br> 
</div>

So, in consultation with Professor Brueckner I decided to make my project more of an exploration of acrylic engraving and the virtues of that. <br>
I already have a record shelf anyway. <br>
The first thought I had about layered acrylic was about etching ascii art onto it for some reason. <br>
In searching for ascii optical illusions I stumbled upon chris.com which inspired me with the stereograms page. <br>
<a href="http://www.chris.com/ascii/index.php?art=art%20and%20design/stereograms">that page</a> <br>
I began my process by adapting some of their designs to the lasercutter, like the dot grid. <br>
Here's my first cut files and the results. <br>

These were pretty cool but didn't have that much of a dimensional effect, <br>
in addition the diamond shape didn't cut out because it was formatted as text instead of as a vector in illustrator. <br>
So I went back in illustrator and re-did the diamond with all lines and added a few other crazy shapes that were slated to do moire effects when layered. <br>

Some of these came out cool and I fooled around with them and plan on fleshing them out further. The first one is the diamond <br>
</div>

It has a nice 3D effect and the layers translated well. <br>

I hope to make a bigger one with more layers of this one at some point. <br>
The next one is the kinetic moire circles. <br>
I made these by having the laser cutter etch circles very close to each other repeatedly. <br>
it made this rough, and more organic texture. <br>

I initially intended it to look like a rose when layered but more it looked like a pyramid cake or a pile of dirt <br>
I didn't have a long enough 6-32 screw to put it all together as one composite shape but ended up doing it with spacers. <br>
And then I noticed it could spin, occasionally lining up the pattern originally intended. <br>

I plan on putting a servo motor behind it and making it a simple kinetic sculpture. <br>
Another of the outcomes is this little moire intersection.
